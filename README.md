## THP W12D2 - Developer track - Javascript : sorting all the way !

### :one: Content :scroll:

(Re)learning the different sorting algorithms, from bubble to select, from insert to quick sorts.

### :two: How to :bulb:

1. Create an empty directory on your :computer:
2. Clone the current :octocat: repository to the latter via `git clone .`
3. Fill in the "list.txt" with a random list of - positive and negative - numbers to be sorted
4. Launch the "trieurfou.js" file thanks to a `node trieurfou.js list.txt` command.

### :three: Missing features / Possible evolution :rocket:

- Finalize / Improve quick sort wjicj does not work properly.
- Optimize all sorting algorithm by taking into account the numbers' distribution, etc.
- ...
